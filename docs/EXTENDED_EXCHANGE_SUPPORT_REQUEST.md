## üöÄ **Project Context: StreetCred Mobile Trading App**

We're building **StreetCred** - a gamified mobile trading app for Gen-Z users, integrating with Extended Exchange as our primary trading backend. Our integration is 95% complete and working perfectly, except for the final order creation step.

- ‚ùå **Order Creation**: Getting 400 errors (need correct format)

## üîç **Specific Issue: Order Creation 400 Error**

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/user/order`

**Problem**: All order creation attempts return **400 status with empty response body**

**What We've Tried**:
1. ‚úÖ Multiple order formats based on documentation
2. ‚úÖ Different markets (BTC-USD, EUR-USD, ETH-USD)
3. ‚úÖ Various order types (limit, market)
4. ‚úÖ Conservative parameters (low quantities, safe prices)
5. ‚úÖ Proper authentication headers

## üìä **Current Request Format (Based on Your API Documentation)**

Based on your Extended API documentation from our knowledge base, we're using this format:

```json

  "id": "order_1751983535554_1751983535552",

  "price": "50000",
  "timeInForce": "GTT",
  "expiryEpochMillis": 1752069935552,

    "collateralPosition": "101420"
  },
  "reduceOnly": false,
  "postOnly": false,
  "selfTradeProtectionLevel": "ACCOUNT"
}
```
