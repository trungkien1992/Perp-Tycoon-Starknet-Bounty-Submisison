# Perp Tycoon - Casino Game Design

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Perp Tycoon** is an idle trading casino where you build a crypto empire by turning mock perpetual trades into a satisfying, automated money-making machine, with a daily chance to make a real trade on Starknet. The game fuses the addictive progression of an idle game with the high-stakes thrill of leveraged trading, putting the player in the seat of a casino mogul. The gameplay feels like a Bloomberg terminal collided with a Las Vegas slot machine.

## üéØ Logline

Perp Tycoon is an idle trading casino where you build a crypto empire by turning mock perpetual trades into a satisfying, automated money-making machine, with a daily chance to make a real trade on Starknet. The game is inspired by the Gamblers Table idle game of Itch.io

## üéØ Core Game Loop

### The Perp Tycoon Experience
The player's journey follows a classic, highly-retentive incremental loop:

**TOSS (Manual Trade) ü™ô ‚Üí EARN (Virtual Cash) üí∞ ‚Üí UPGRADE (Boosts & Bots) üõ†Ô∏è ‚Üí AUTOMATE (Idle Income) ü§ñ ‚Üí PRESTIGE (Reset for Perks) üèÜ**

### Primary Mechanics
1. **Manual Trading**: The primary action is a single tap on a "TOSS" button. The player chooses to go LONG (Heads) or SHORT (Tails) on a selected asset
2. **Coin Toss Simulation**: Each tap initiates a satisfyingly robust coin toss with dynamic physics and sharp metallic sound effects
3. **Progression Through Value**: Start with Copper Coin, unlock Silver Coin, then Gold Coin - each with higher base profits and richer sound
4. **Earn & Upgrade**: Successful trades earn cash to buy better trading tools and multipliers
5. **Automate**: Hire trading bots that earn money while offline (idle game mechanics)
6. **Prestige**: Reset all progress to earn privilege  NFTs.
7. **Real Integration**: One actual trade per day via Extended Exchange API

## üé∞ The Idle Casino: Core Interaction

### The Digital "Coin Toss Table"
The game's action is centered on a high-end, digital "Coin Toss Table," which serves as the player's main interface.

**Core Interaction**: Every tap initiates a  coin toss. The coin flips dynamically across the table with a tangible sense of weight before landing with a sharp, metallic clash sound. This sensory feedback is designed to make every action feel impactful and make the player feel rich.

### Coin Progression System

- **Silver Coin**: Offers higher base profits and richer audio feedback
- **Gold Coin**: High-roller tier with largest virtual profits and deeply resonant "cha-ching" sound

- **XP Milestone**: Reach level 50
- **Achievement Combo**: Complete 10 different achievements

- **Bonus**: Permanent multipliers based on Stark Token count

## üé≤ Trade Simulation Engine

### Coin Toss Mechanics
The outcome‚Äîwhether the player's bet was correct‚Äîis determined by a provably fair, random result, creating a 50/50 chance similar to a real coin flip. The magnitude of the Profit or Loss is then calculated based on the real-time market volatility of the chosen asset.

### Volatility-Based Outcomes
```dart
// Trade outcome calculation
bool isWin = Random().nextDouble() < (baseWinRate + upgradeBonus);
double volatility = getMarketVolatility(selectedMarket);
double pnl = (isWin ? 1 : -1) * volatility * leverageMultiplier;
```

### Market Behavior & Volatility
- **High Volatility**: Results in larger potential wins and losses
- **Low Volatility**: Results in smaller, more consistent outcomes

### Visual & Audio Feedback
- **Win (Profit)**: Screen showers with cash, PnL indicator flashes green, virtual dollars added to vault, satisfying "cha-ching" sound
- **Loss (Miss)**: Even losing trades reward the player with XP, ensuring every tap feels productive
- **Trader Avatar**: Launches at a mini slot machine with reels spinning market symbols (bulls, bears, rockets) before settling on PnL result

## üí∞ Game Economy Balance

### Progression Curve
1. **Early Game (Levels 1-10)**: Manual tapping, first upgrades
2. **Mid Game (Levels 11-30)**: First bots, automation begins
3. **Late Game (Levels 31-50)**: Multiple bots, advanced upgrades
4. **End Game (50+)**: Prestige preparation, Stark Token accumulation

### Cash Flow Formula
```dart
// Total earnings calculation
double totalEarnings = manualTapEarnings + botPassiveEarnings;
double manualTapEarnings = tapCount * baseTapValue * winRate * multipliers;
double botPassiveEarnings = Œ£(botYields * timeElapsed);
```

### Balance Considerations
- **Tap vs Idle**: Manual tapping should be profitable early, bots dominate later
- **Upgrade Costs**: Exponential scaling to maintain progression challenge
- **Prestige Timing**: Players should prestige every 2-3 hours of active play
