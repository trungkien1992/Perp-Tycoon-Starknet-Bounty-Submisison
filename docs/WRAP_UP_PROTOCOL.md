- [ ] Add any new insights to relevant documentation

#### 2. **Code Quality Check** (REQUIRED)
- [ ] All code changes tested and working
- [ ] No broken functionality left behind
- [ ] Error handling implemented for new features
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and conventions

#### 3. **System Health Check** (REQUIRED)
```bash
# RAG Backend Health
cd rag_backend

flutter test

# Git Status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

#### 4. **Progress Documentation** (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Mark TodoWrite tasks as completed
- [ ] Document any blockers or dependencies
- [ ] Note estimated time for remaining tasks
- [ ] Update next session priorities

## ðŸ”„ Standard Wrap-Up Sequence

### Step 1: Test Current State
```bash
# Test RAG backend
cd rag_backend && source venv/bin/activate && python test_rag.py

# Test Flutter app
flutter test && flutter analyze

# Check system health
curl -s http://localhost:8000/ && echo "âœ… RAG Backend OK"
```

### Step 2: Update Documentation
Update these files in order:
1. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - What was completed
2. `TODO.md` - Current task status and next priorities
3. `MEMORIES.md` - Important decisions and learnings
4. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Any issues encountered (if any)

### Step 3: Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Create descriptive commit message
git commit -m "Session wrap-up: [describe main accomplishments]

- Updated RAG system with [specific changes]
- Resolved [issues fixed]
- Added [new features/improvements]

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Prepare for Next Session
- [ ] Create clear next actions in TODO.md
- [ ] Note any context future Claude should know
- [ ] Set up system for easy continuation
- [ ] Document any environment changes needed

   git add .
   git commit -m "Emergency save: work in progress"
   
   # Document current state
   echo "EMERGENCY STOP: [describe current state]" >> docs/MEMORIES.md
   ```

2. **Minimal Documentation**:
   - Update TODO.md with current task status
   - Note any incomplete work in MEMORIES.md
   - Mark any broken functionality in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

3. **System State**:
   - Leave RAG backend running if stable
   - Note any unstable components
   - Document exact steps to resume

## ðŸ“‹ File Update Checklist

### Always Update
- [ ] `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Progress and current state
- [ ] `TODO.md` - Task status and next priorities

### Never Skip
- [ ] Git commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to remote repository
- [ ] System health check before ending

## ðŸ”„ Handoff Instructions

### For Next Claude Session
