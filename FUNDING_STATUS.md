## Current Status
❓ **FUNDING STATUS UNKNOWN** - API endpoints returning 404 errors

## Test Results
When running funding verification tests, the following responses were received:
- `/v1/account/balance` → 404 Not Found
- `/v1/positions` → 404 Not Found

2. **Vault Setup**: Vault 101420 may not exist or require additional setup
3. **API Key Activation**: The API key may need activation or permission grants
4. **Account Funding**: The account may require initial deposit before API access

## Required Actions for Real Trading

### 1. Verify API Endpoint

### 2. Account Setup
- Ensure vault 101420 exists and is properly configured
- Verify API key has necessary permissions for:
  - Account balance queries

  - Market data access

### 3. Funding Requirements
Extended API perpetual futures trading typically requires:
